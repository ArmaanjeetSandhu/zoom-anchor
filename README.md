# Zoom Anchor ⚓️

**Zoom Anchor** is a browser extension to lock your current zoom level and disable horizontal scrolling. It allows you to position a webpage exactly how you want it—perfectly centred with balanced margins—and "anchor" it in place, preventing accidental swipes or trackpad gestures from ruining your reading layout.

## Motivation

Many reading-focused websites (e.g., news sites, blogs) don't centre their text. The main content competes with sidebars full of ads, article recommendations, newsletter signup forms, and other distractions. Current workarounds all fall short:

- **Ad blockers** remove ads but leave other sidebar elements intact.
- **Element removers** hide distractions but don't centre the remaining text.
- **Reader modes** strip away all personality — the site's typography, animations, and visual identity.

None of these solutions replicate the true e-reader experience of centred text with balanced margins that preserves the website's design character.

A common workaround is to zoom in on the text such that it appears centred. But the two-finger scroll gesture on trackpads occasionally triggers unintended horizontal movement, breaking that carefully aligned view. You're left constantly readjusting, which interrupts the flow of reading.

**That's why Zoom Anchor exists.** It lets you align the page once and lock it, so you can scroll vertically to read without fear of drifting sideways or accidentally zooming out.

## How It Works

- **Lock your view**: Press **`Alt + L`** after positioning the page how you want it. The extension displays a "🔒 Locked" overlay and turns the toolbar icon red.
- **Scroll freely**: Vertical scrolling works normally, but horizontal scrolling and zoom gestures are disabled.
- **Fine-tune alignment**: Make minor horizontal adjustments by performing the two-finger trackpad gesture slowly and diagonally.
- **Unlock anytime**: Press **`Alt + L`** again to restore normal browsing. The overlay shows "🔓 Unlocked" and the icon returns to white.
